# CQ6

For the insertion sort part 2, this has a time complexity of O(n^2) because of the nested loops. It has a space complexity of O(1) because the memory does not rely on the size of the input.

Recursion: If it finds a positive number the biggest sum will be found. If not, no good sum is found. If it's checked every number, it ends. It will look at the current number. Depending on the situation (positive number) it will add it to the sum or hold the bigger number found. Then it moves to the next number in the list and repeats until the end of the array.
